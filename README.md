- **Docker**: Docker for containerization.
- **AWS EC2**: Cloud provider for hosting WebApp.
- **Linux**: Ubuntu is used for server configuration and management.
- **DockerHub**: Private docker repository.
- **Git**: Version Control System.
- **GitLab**: Git Repository.
- **Java & Maven**: Nana's application and build tools.
  

## üéØ Features

- **Automated Deployment**: Deploys application updates directly from Jenkins to EC2.
- **Secure SSH Access**: Uses Jenkins credentials to securely connect to the EC2 instance.
- **Dockerized Application**: Builds and runs the application in a Docker container.
- **Pipeline Integration**: Extends the CI process to include deployment.
- **Security Group Configuration**: Ensures proper access to the deployed application.
